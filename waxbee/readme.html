<h1>WaxBee Configuration tool</h1>

This tool is meant to prepare a firmware to be loaded in a Teensy 2.0 board. 

<p>Home site: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/waxbee/">http://code.google.com/p/waxbee/</a>

<h2>To Install</h2>
Just unzip the package somewhere handy.

Make sure you have a Java 1.6 (or more recent) installed on your system.

<h2>To Run</h2>

To run, simply double-click the <b>waxbee.jar</b> file or invoke it on the command line with:

javaw -jar waxbee.jar

<h2>Teensy Loader</h2>

The tool has a built-in "teensy loader" that will recognize the Teensy through the USB port.

Alternatively, the Teensy Loader software may be used to upload a .hex file generated by this tool.

This utility has only been tested on Windows. Since this is mostly a java application, most of the 
functionality is supposed to work anywhere. As of this writing the Teensy loader portion only works on Windows. 
(The support for linux and Mac OS X is not far off, the supporting code is there and is known to work. It just 
needs a bit of packaging and love).

<h2>Guide</h2>

First: Make sure you know what you are doing. Visit: forum.bongofish.co.uk 

<h2>Pick a template</h2>
Select "New from Template" and pick a template that matches your serial (or ADB) tablet and what type of emulation you would like.

Normally picking a USB tablet of the same size is preferable.

<h4>No suitable template</h4>
If not in the list, pick one of a similar series.  (like pick a UD-* for a UD-* tablet). You will then have to tweak the settings 
(the max coordinates comes to mind). There are few ways to discover this. You may ask the question on the forum: forum.bongofish.co.uk 

<h2>Program Device</h2>

If on Windows and programming to the Teensy, you should be able to use the "Program Device" option. Else, pick the "Generate .hex" and 
use whatever tool(s) that works with the board you have to load this .hex to the AVR-based board. For example, with the Teensy, you should 
use the Teensy Loader (prjc.com).
