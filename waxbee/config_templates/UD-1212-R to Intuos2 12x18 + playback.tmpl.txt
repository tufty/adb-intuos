# A note about this file and its format for the braves that wants to tweak stuff
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Do not change anything here unless you think you know what you are doing. :)
#
# Note that even if it stops working (a thing that can happen quite easily),
# there are virtually no chances that you break something 'physically'.
#
# In any case, it cannot 'brick' the WaxBee, there is always a way out. At worse,
# it might crash your OS (or the USB driver) or make it install USB drivers you
# did not want. Nothing that cannot be fixed.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration items have the format :
#
#   NAME = 123
#
# Numeric values can be expressed as base-10 (decimal) or base-16 (hexadecimal) 
# The hexadecimal notation requires 0x to be prepended. Example: 0x5e
#
# Text requires double-quotes as delimiters.

# Text comments starts with a # and goes up to the end of the line. Empty lines
# are OK.

# Each entry has a multi-line comment shown before. These are fixed. They will
# will be overridden when the WaxBee Config utility writes-back this file when
# 'saving'.
#
# Each value can have a one-line comment attached which will be shown after the
# value on the same line. This comment is tied to the value and will be 
# retained after a read/write of the file (unless the value changed).

# About multi-byte values (e.g. @[ ... ] ):
#
# The values are separated by commas and can be expressed as base-10 (decimal)
# or base-16 (hexadecimal). The hexadecimal notation requires 0x to be
# prepended.
#
# Each value is normally shown one byte (8 bits) at a time, but two bytes (16 
# bits) are supported.# Currently, only bytes in 'Little-Endian mode' is
# supported. Use the notation: LE16() (i.e. Little Endian, 16-bits). 
#
# For example:
#
# 	LE16(0x0c17),
#
# A one-line comment can be 'attached' to a value location, that comment
# reflects all the bytes that occurred before the previous comment and should be
# shown together (on the same line).  These comments are tied to the 'values'.
# These comments will be retained when the WaxBee Config tool reads/writes a 
# configuration file.
#
# Typically a configuration is always a 'copy' of an existing one which already
# contained commented values
