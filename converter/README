This is a largely proof-of-concept USB converter for ADB-equipped Intuos tablets.

Credits
-------

Work on this has been heavily inspired by Bernard Poulin's stellar work on Waxbee, which 
converts serial-equipped wacom tablets, and the ultrapad / artZ series of ADB tablets,
to USB.  Indeed, large portions of the low level ADB and USB handling code have been pulled
pretty much direct from Waxbee.  Without Bernard, I'd still be in the mire of making 
OSX-specific drivers.

Figuring out the Intuos ADB protocol has been a mix of dumping ADB traffic, oscilloscope 
traces (again thanks to Bernard), and manual decompiling of the original Mac driver supplied
with the Intuos tablets.  The latter part of this was made harder by not actually having the 
tools to do the job, and having to develop those tools first (using the wonderful "petite
chez scheme").

What this does
--------------

Effectively it's a "brain bypass" for the tablet.  A small AVR microcontroller board 
(the "Teensy 2.0" from pjrc.com) sits between the host computer and the tablet itself, 
identifying itself as an Intuos 2 tablet to the computer, and talking the ADB intuos 1 
protocol to the tablet, converting dat formats as necessary.  This allows use of a 
"stock" Wacom driver supporting the Intuos 2 range of tablets on the host computer.

Intuos 2 was chosen because it's the last range of tablets supporting dual-track.  
Unfortunately, this restricts the host comuter to using the v6.20 driver from Wacom, and
therefore may preclude use on Windows 8.

What's supported
----------------

* Automatic detection of tablet type, and identification as an "equivalent" Intuos 2.
* Dual tool tracking
* Tool ID (allowing different settings for different, same model, tools on the tablet)
* Tablet button bar
* Intuos standard pen : fully supported
* * Full resolution location tracking (2540lpi, up to 200 pps)
* * 1024 pressure levels
* * +- 60 degrees tilt in X and Y directions
* * Side buttons
* * Eraser
* Intuos 4D Mouse : partial support
* * Full resolution location tracking (2540lpi, up to 200 pps)
* * All buttons supported
* * Rotation
* * Wheel (partial support)

What's not supported
--------------------

Tools other than the standard pen and 4d mouse.  

What's needed to use this on your ADB-equipped Intuos tablet
------------------------------------------------------------

1 "Teensy 2.0" AVR board.
1 pull-up resistor.
Soldering skills.
Dremel / box cutter etc and a stedy hand for "neat" fitment of teensy in tablet housing.

To Do
-----

* Check 4d mouse rotation (may be inverted, need to find some rotation-aware software)
* Sort out the sign of 4d mouse wheel reports.
* Get hold of some other tools - 2D mouse, airbrush, inking pen, stroke pen, grip pen, lens cursor
* Incorporate support for ultrapad series, calcomp tablets.
