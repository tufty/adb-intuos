This is a largely proof-of-concept USB converter for ADB-equipped Intuos tablets.

Work on this has been heavily inspired by Bernard Poulin's stellar work on Waxbee, which 
converts serial-equipped wacom tablets, and the ultrapad / artZ series of ADB tablets,
to USB.  Indeed, large portions of the low level ADB and USB handling code have been pulled
pretty much direct from Waxbee.  Without Bernard, I'd still be in the mire of making 
OSX-specific drivers.

Figuring out the Intuos ADB protocol has been a mix of dumping ADB traffic, oscilloscope 
traces (again thanks to Bernard), and manual decompiling of the original Mac driver supplied
with the Intuos tablets.  The latter part of this was made harder by not actually having the 
tools to do the job, and having to develop those tools first (using the wonderful "petite
chez scheme").

The converter itself would be hard to make, were it not for pjrc's rather nifty and inexpensive
"Teensy" range of microcontrollers, which are not only easy to use, but also small enough to 
allow placement inside the casing of a Wacom tablet.

Obviously, none of this would be possible at all were it not for the work of Wacom themselves,
and although they were unable to help directly for commercial / legal reasons, I can ony 
admire the work they evidently put into the Intuos range of tablets in order to get around the
restrictions of ADB's low performance.  Wacom's engineers obviously cared enough about truth
in advertising to make sure that "up to 200 samples per second" really meant "200 samples
per second, 99% of the time", regardless of how improable that seems on the surface.

The other things that made this possible are the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc), and Richard
Stallman's remarkable "Emacs", which I simply can't live without.

What this does
--------------

Effectively it's a "brain bypass" for the tablet.  A small AVR microcontroller board 
(the "Teensy 2.0" from pjrc.com) sits between the host computer and the tablet itself, 
identifying itself as an Intuos 2 tablet to the computer, and talking the ADB intuos 1 
protocol to the tablet, converting data formats as necessary.  This allows use of a 
"stock" Wacom driver supporting the Intuos 2 range of tablets on the host computer.

Intuos 2 was chosen because it's the last range of tablets supporting dual-track.  
Unfortunately, this restricts the host computer to using the v6.20 driver from Wacom, and
therefore may preclude use on Windows 8.  It definitely precludes use on OSX 10.9+
without specifically allowing unsigned drivers (and even then, the prefs pane simply
won't work).

What's supported
----------------

* Automatic detection of tablet type, and identification as an "equivalent" Intuos 2.
* Dual tool tracking
* Tool ID (allowing different settings for different, same model, tools on the tablet)
* Tablet button bar
* Intuos standard pen : fully supported
* * Full resolution location tracking (2540lpi, up to 200 pps)
* * 1024 pressure levels
* * +- 60 degrees tilt in X and Y directions
* * Side buttons
* * Eraser
* Intuos 4D Mouse : partial support
* * Full resolution location tracking (2540lpi, up to 200 pps)
* * All buttons supported
* * Rotation (may be inverted)
* * Scroll / throttle wheel

What's not supported
--------------------

Tools other than the standard pen and 4d mouse.  Yet.

What's needed to use this on your ADB-equipped Intuos tablet
------------------------------------------------------------

1 "Teensy 2.0" AVR board.
1 pull-up resistor.
Soldering skills.
Dremel / box cutter etc and a stedy hand for "neat" fitment of teensy in tablet housing.

To Do
-----

* Check 4d mouse rotation (may be inverted, need to find some rotation-aware software)
* Get hold of some other tools - 2D mouse, airbrush, inking pen, stroke pen, grip pen, lens cursor
* Incorporate support for ultrapad series, calcomp tablets.
* Support imitating Intuos3 or higher, allowing use of more recent drivers.
